# Lung Tumor Classification Using DenseNet121

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project implements a **state-of-the-art deep learning pipeline** for classifying lung tumors as either **benign** or **malignant** using the powerful DenseNet121 architecture. Leveraging transfer learning and advanced data augmentation, the model achieves high accuracy on medical X-ray images, helping radiologists make faster and more reliable diagnoses.

## üîç Dataset

- The dataset consists of chest X-ray images stored in Google Drive.
- Metadata is stored in CSV files, detailing image filenames and corresponding labels (`benign` or `malignant`).
- Stratified K-Fold cross-validation (K=10) is applied to ensure balanced and robust evaluation.
